# dhsc_data_tools package

**Stable branch: main**

The goal of DHSCdatatools is to provide a suite of tools for using data hosted on the DHSC analytical cloud (DAC) platform. 
[For detailed developer documentation click here.](https://github.com/DataS-DHSC/dhsc-data-tools/tree/main/docs/dhsc_data_tools)

## Pre-requisites

A new conda environment is recommended for the package. In Git Bash:

```
conda create -n <your_environment_name> pip python-dotenv
```

## To install the dhsc_data_tools package

In Git Bash, with your relevant environment activated:

```
pip install git+https://github.com/DataS-DHSC/dhsc-data-tools.git
```

## .env and config files

A .env file containing tenant name and key vault name is required for `dhsc_data_tools.dac_odbc.connect()` and `dhsc_data_tools.keyvault.KVConnection()`.
Please find the .env file in the [Data Science Teams space DAC channel](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3ad94b5e4692d043249285162a04b35d12%40thread.tacv2/DAC%2520(DHSC%2520analytical%2520cloud)?groupId=88d91456-9588-4bed-a713-fde91b11a227&tenantId=61278c30-91a8-4c31-8c1f-ef4de8973a1c).

Place this file in your working directory. 

**IMPORTANT**

**Ensure in each project your `.gitignore` file excludes config, `.env`, and relevant yaml files.**
If you do accidentally commit these files (or any other sensitive data) please get in touch with the [Data Science Hub](mailto:datascience@dhsc.gov.uk) to discuss how best to mitigate the breach.

## Example use scripts

### Connecting to the DAC data using an SQL endpoint

```python
from dhsc_data_tools import dac_odbc
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv(".env")

#create client
conn = dac_odbc.connect()

# Run a SQL query by using the preceding connection.
cursor = conn.cursor()
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM samples.nyctaxi.trips LIMIT 10")

# Print the rows retrieved from the query.
for row in cursor.fetchall():
    print(row)

# For help, you can run
help(dac_odbc.connect) # or with any other module

```
